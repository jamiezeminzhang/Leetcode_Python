191. Number of 1 Bits My Submissions Question

Total Accepted: 74814 Total Submissions: 198879 Difficulty: Easy
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has 
(also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, 
so the function should return 3.
