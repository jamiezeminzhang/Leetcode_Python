75. Sort Colors My Submissions Question
Total Accepted: 84798 Total Submissions: 249912 Difficulty: Medium
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that 
objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, 
white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, 
and blue respectively.

Note:
You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Follow up:
A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite 
array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.

Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

1.	用left， right两个指针。如果nums[i]为0，与left交换,left+=1,i+=1
2.	如果nums[i]为2，与right交换，right-=1。这时候不动i，因为此时的nums[i]是刚交换过来的新数字，需要判断颜色。
3.	如果nums[i]为1，i++。
