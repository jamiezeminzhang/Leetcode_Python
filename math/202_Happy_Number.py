202. Happy Number

Total Accepted: 54462 Total Submissions: 153037 Difficulty: Easy

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, 
replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number 
equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number

1**2 + 9**2 = 82
8**2 + 2**2 = 68
6**2 + 8**2 = 100
1**2 + 0**2 + 0**2 = 1

模拟题，循环过程中用set记录每次得到的平方和

当出现非1的重复平方和时，返回False

否则，返回True
