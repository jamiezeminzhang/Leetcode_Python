242. Valid Anagram My Submissions Question

Total Accepted: 60985 Total Submissions: 149315 Difficulty: Easy
Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

For example,
s = "anagram", t = "nagaram", return true.
s = "rat", t = "car", return false.

Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

Follow up:
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?
